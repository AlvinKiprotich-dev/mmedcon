# COVID-19 Global Dashboard 
- Access dashboard from: [`Site`](https://alvinkiprotich-dev-mmedcon-app-hdcbit.streamlit.app/)

An interactive, data-driven dashboard for visualizing and analyzing global COVID-19 statistics using real-time API data. This project demonstrates my ability to work with public health data, clean and transform it, apply machine learning, and present insights through modern visual tools.

> **Built entirely by me using Python, Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.**

##  Features

-  **Live API integration** for up-to-date global and per-country COVID-19 stats
-  **Bar charts** of top N countries by total cases
-  **Choropleth map** to visualize spread by country and metric
-  **KMeans clustering** to categorize countries by risk
-  **Country profiles** with key health indicators
-  **Global and country-level historical trends** (30-day)
-  **Country comparison** across multiple health indicators
-  **Downloadable data** (CSV)
-  **Auto-refresh toggle** for dynamic updates

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for UI & interactivity
- **Plotly** for interactive charts & maps
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Requests** to call the `disease.sh` API
- **Scikit-Learn** for KMeans clustering
